## Dependency
1 . For using ohoschannel module in sample app, include the source code and add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle to generate hap/support.har.
```groovy
	dependencies {
		implementation project(path: ':ohoschannel')
                implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.har'])
                testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
	}
```
2 . For using ohoschannel in separate application using har file, add the har file in the entry/libs folder and add the dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.
```groovy
	dependencies {
		implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.har'])
		testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
	}
```

## Usage

### Ping-Pong 

You can make a channel between main thread and worker thread easily.
```java
channel = new OhosChannel(new OhosChannel.UiCallback() {
    @Override
    public boolean handleUiMessage(InnerEvent msg) {
        if (msg.eventId == PING) {
            HiLog.debug(HI_LOG_LABEL, " PING");
            ohosChannel.toWorker().sendEvent(PONG, 1000);
        }
        return false;
    }
}, new OhosChannel.WorkerCallback() {
    @Override
    public boolean handleWorkerMessage(InnerEvent msg) {
        if (msg.eventId == PONG) {
            HiLog.debug(HI_LOG_LABEL, " PONG");
            ohosChannel.toUi().sendEvent(PING, 1000);
        }
        return false;
    }
});
channel.toUi().sendEvent(PING);
```

### Timer

If you use OHOSChannel, You can make Timer more easily. I already made Timer class for you. You can just use it. If you want to know how to implement Timer class, you just read [souce code](https://github.com/skyfe79/AndroidChannel/blob/master/androidchannel/src/main/java/kr/pe/burt/android/lib/androidchannel/Timer.java) in the package.

```java
timer = new Timer(1000, new Timer.OnTimer() {
    int count = 0;
    @Override
    public void onTime(Timer timer) {
        count++;
        textView.setText("count : " + count);
    }
});
timer.start();	
```

You can also stop the timer like this.
```java
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(TouchEvent event) {
    if (event.getAction() == TouchEvent.PRIMARY_POINT_UP) {
        if (timer.isAlive()) {
            timer.stop();
        } else {
            timer.start();
        }
    }
    return super.onTouchEvent(event);
}
```

## APIs

* channel.open()
 * Use open() method to open channel. If you created a channel by Channel constructor, it is automatically open the channel by default. 
* channel.close() 
 * Use close() method to close channel. close() method removes callbacks and messages in the message queue.
* channel.toUI() 
 * toUI() method returns main thread handler. If you want to send messages to ui thread you should use toUI() method.
* channel.toWorker()
 * toWorker() method returns worker thread handler. If you want to send messages to worker thread you should use toWorker() method.
