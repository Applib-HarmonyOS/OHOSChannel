# AndroidChannel

[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-AndroidChannel-green.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/2547)

AndroidChannel is helper library for inter thread communication between main thread and worker thread. AndroidChannel uses HandlerThread for inter thread communication.



## Setup Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
	...
    compile 'kr.pe.burt.android.lib:androidchannel:0.0.4'
}
```

## Example

### AndroidChannel-ProgressLayout

I have reimplemented [ProgressLayout](https://github.com/iammert/ProgressLayout) by using AndroidChannel for example. You can check out souce code at [AndroidChannel-ProgressLayout](example/AndroidChannel-ProgressLayout). It shows how to use AndroidChannel when you want to implement a custom animatable view.

### Ping-Pong 

You can make a channel between main thread and worker thread easily.

```java
channel = new AndroidChannel(new AndroidChannel.UiCallback() {
    @Override
    public boolean handleUiMessage(Message msg) {

        if(msg.what == PING) {
            Log.d("TAG", "PING");
            channel.toWorker().sendEmptyMessageDelayed(PONG, 1000);
        }
        return false;
    }
}, new AndroidChannel.WorkerCallback() {
    @Override
    public boolean handleWorkerMessage(Message msg) {

        if(msg.what == PONG) {
            Log.d("TAG", "PONG");
            channel.toUI().sendEmptyMessageDelayed(PING, 1000);
        }
        return false;
    }
});
channel.toUI().sendEmptyMessage(PING);
```

### Timer

If you use AndroidChannel, You can make Timer more easily. I already make Timer class for you. You can just use it. If you want to know how to implement Timer class, you just read [souce code](https://github.com/skyfe79/AndroidChannel/blob/master/androidchannel/src/main/java/kr/pe/burt/android/lib/androidchannel/Timer.java) in the package.

```java
timer = new Timer(1000, new Timer.OnTimer() {
    int count = 0;
    @Override
    public void onTime(Timer timer) {
        count++;
        textView.setText("count : " + count);
    }
});
timer.start();	
```

You can also stop the timer like this.

```java
@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
    if(event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) {
        if(timer.isAlive()) {
            timer.stop();
        } else {
            timer.start();
        }
    }
    return super.onTouchEvent(event);
}
```

## APIs

* channel.open()
 * Use open() method to open channel. If you created a channel by Channel constructor, it is automatically open the channel by default. 
* channel.close() 
 * Use close() method to close channel. close() method removes callbacks and messages in the message queue.
* channel.toUI() 
 * toUI() method returns main thread handler. If you want to send messages to ui thread you should use toUI() method.
* channel.toWorker()
 * toWorker() method returns worker thread handler. If you want to send messages to worker thread you should use toWorker() method.
